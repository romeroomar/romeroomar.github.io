## Early Life
Ye was born in Atlanta, Georgia on June 8, 1977. When he was three years old his parents divorced and he ended up moving with him mom to Chicago, Illinois. His father, Ray West, is a former black panther which Ye has mentioned many times before and later became a Christian counselor. His mother, Dr. Donda C. West, was an English professor at Clark Atlanta University.

It is said that Ye had a likeness for the arts at a very young age. His mother recalled that she first took notice of West's passion for drawing and music when he was in the third grade. After graduating from high school, West received a scholarship to attend Chicago's American Academy of Art in 1997 and began taking painting classes. Shortly after, he transferred to Chicago State University to study English. There was a conflict with his busy schedule and the time he had to make music so he ended up dropping out of college in order to pursue his musical dreams.

## Career
Ye started his early music career by producing beats for other rappers that were relatively small at the time. He eventually got his big break in the year 2000 when he started producing for artists on Roc-A-Fella which is a huge record label cofounded by Jay-Z and two others. He started gaining recognition when he started making beats for Jay-Z and especially for his contribution to Jay-Z's 2001 hit album *The Blueprint*.

Even though Ye gained a lot of success being a producer, what he really wanted to do was be a rapper. His breakthrough happened in 2002 when he was involved in a terrible car accident that left him with a shattered jaw. His jaw had to be wired shut in reconstructive surgery and two weeks after being admitted from the hospital he decided to record a song called *Through the Wire*. This song blew up and around the same time he announced that he was coming out with an album called *The College Dropout*.

*The College Dropout* was released in 2004 and recieved critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, it was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. The commercial success from his debut album gave him the funds to hire a string orchestra for his second album *Late Registration*. This album was also a commercial success and Ye was only going up from here. *Graduation (2007)*, *808s & Heartbreak (2008)*, *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010)*, *Yeezus (2013)*, *The Life of Pablo (2016)*, *Ye (2018)*, *Jesus Is King (2019)*, *Donda (2021)*, and *Donda 2 (2022)*. These are all his studio albums that he put out and there are more to come.

## 2020 presidential campaign

On July 7, West was interviewed by Forbes about his presidential run, where he announced that his running mate would be Wyoming preacher Michelle Tidball, and that he would run as an independent under the "Birthday Party".
